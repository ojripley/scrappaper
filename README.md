# Scrap Paper

### I used up the last page of my notebook the other day.

### Instead of buying a new one, this is for writing down all the little things that pop into your brain.

## General Concept

Make it easy to jot anything down. The fewer steps for the user, the better. Autoprompt, autosave, etc.

## Stack

- React
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB

## Dev Goals

It's been awhile since I've written any test code, so for this project I'm going to revist mocha & chai. Get that coverage baby.

Also will be the first major project I've worked on with MongoDB.
